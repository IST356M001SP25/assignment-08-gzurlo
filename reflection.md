This assignment deepened my understanding of ETL pipelines and interactive dashboard design with Streamlit. I particularly struggled with merging DataFrames efficiently in etl.py to preserve coordinates while aggregating amounts, which clarified the importance of pandas' groupby and merge operations. For future practice, I need to explore more advanced PyDeck layer configurations to improve map visualizations, like adjusting radius scaling dynamically based on data ranges.
